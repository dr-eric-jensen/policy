## Seeking postdoc


The National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign invites applications for a 2-year position of postdoctoral researcher in research software policy, possibly working remotely. The selected candidate will be part of the distributed US Research Software Sustainability Institute (URSSI, https://urssi.us) (also see the URSSI implementation plan: https://plan.urssi.us) under a two-year award from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to NCSA, led by Daniel S. Katz.

This policy project asks “How can policy be used to increase the sustainability and impact of research software in the scholarly research community?” The project has three objectives: 1) influencing positive policy changes, 2) understanding why such changes succeed and fail in this context, and 3) planning for future policy work based on these lessons. The postdoc will work with PI Katz to accomplish the project tasks over two years:

1) Assemble and maintain a list of potential policy activities (with elements of both policy research and policy advocacy); 2) Accomplish some of these policy activities; 3) Document the lessons from these policy activities and use this to plan and propose an expanded and improved research policy center.

Applicants from diverse backgrounds and/or members of groups currently underrepresented in academia are particularly encouraged to apply. You will find a welcoming environment here. A salary of $70k/year has been budgeted for this position, and the postdoc will be supported in completing publications from existing projects. The postdoc may be eligible for the benefits extended to full-time status University employees, including health, vision, and dental insurance, and will earn 24 days of vacation per academic year, as well as 13 days of non-cumulative, non-compensable sick days per academic year. NCSA is also developing a center-wide postdoc program to build community, provide training and professional development, and support mentoring. Additionally, other URSSI leaders will be available to provide support and career development guidance. Please see https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/about/careers/#po for more details and to apply.
